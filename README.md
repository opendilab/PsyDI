## Introduction to PsyDI

PsyDI is a multi-modal and interactive chatbot for psychological assessments. Its objective is to explore users' potential cognitive styles through interactive analysis of their multimodal inputs, finally determining their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Additionally, PsyDI offers feedback in the form of customized figures and detailed analysis for each user. We are continuously improving PsyDI, with upcoming features such as an MBTI gallery. Your feedback is valuable to us!

PsyDI can now be accessed directly via our [web link](https://psydi.opendilab.org.cn/).

## :star_struck: Quick Start

Getting started with PsyDI is easy! Follow these simple steps to begin your journey of self-discovery:

:rocket: **Accessing PsyDI Online:** Visit our [website](https://psydi.opendilab.org.cn/) to access PsyDI directly online. No downloads or installations required!

:memo: **Beginning the Quiz:**
   - Upon entering the quiz, you'll be prompted to choose a label that best represents you. This helps PsyDI tailor the assessment to your personality.
   - Next, you'll be asked to share one of your recent favorite songs and your most recent thoughts. This information provides valuable insights into your current mindset and preferences.

## :key: PsyDI Mini Pipeline

We offer a mini version of the PsyDI pipeline as a demo, making it accessible for everyone to use. This mini pipeline allows users to input several initial posts and generates an initial MBTI score table. It then selects posts with the highest likelihood of having deep meaning to initiate a multi-turn dialogue with the user. After the dialogue, the pipeline updates the user's MBTI score table. Such mini pipeline is the core module of PsyDI as mentioned in the [Introduction](#books-introduction).

In this mini pipeline, we apply [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/) as a large language model example to provide multi-turn dialogue. Users can also replace it with any other language model with multi-turn dialogue capabilities.

## Installation
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :books: Introduction

<div align="center">
    <img width="1000px" height="auto" src="https://github.com/opendilab/PsyDI/blob/main/assets/psydi_pipeline.jpg"></a>
</div>
PsyDI operates on the principle that understanding a user's expressed thoughts involves delving deeper into the underlying cognitive processes. By uncovering these cognitive processes, PsyDI can identify the user's commonly used cognitive styles and ultimately determine their Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).

### Evaluation Framework

At the core of PsyDI's evaluation process is a table of MBTI scores, following established psychological testing methods. Each row of this table represents the probability of the current user being assigned to a specific MBTI type, ranging from 0 to 100.

### Process Description

PsyDI first converts the user's multimodal information into text form. The score model then evaluates these textual expressions, providing probabilities for each sentence being associated with any MBTI type. PsyDI iterates through the following three steps until determining the user's MBTI:

1. **Post Selection:**
    PsyDI selects the post with the highest scores under both of the two MBTI types with the Top-2 probabilities. This step aims to pinpoint the most ambiguous information and prompt further questions to clarify.

2. **Dialog Interaction:**
    PsyDI engages the user in multiple rounds of dialog, utilizing three interaction formats: multiple choice, forced choice, and free question and answer. All the question and answer pairs are integrated into a new post.

3. **Table Update:**
    PsyDI updates the MBTI score table with the new post, incorporating the insights gained from the dialog interaction.

### Iterative Refinement

PsyDI iterates through these steps until it reaches a confident determination of the user's MBTI, continually refining its understanding through each interaction.

## Roadmap
- [x] Online deployment of PsyDI
- [x] Release all the frontend code and deployment scripts
- [x] MBTI evaluation gallery
- [ ] Other language support (English/Korean/Japanese)
- [ ] Release the backend code examples and prompts
- [ ] Release the generated datasets and the trained reward model
- [ ] Technical report arxiv link
- [ ] More multi-modal and interactive questions and examples

## Running Frontend Locally

You will first need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run PsyDI agent.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

Then you need to install node.js (v18.17.0 is recommended) and npm on your machine. 

After setting up all the prerequisites, you can run the following commands to start the frontend:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev --port 3001
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/).
